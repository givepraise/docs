# Getting started

Praise isn't offered as a service. Instead, every community runs its own server. The installation process requires only basic server knowledge and takes about 30 minutes. We have verified the installation on Digital Ocean but should with little or no modifications work on any Ubuntu server.

Praise can also be run locally for evaluation purposes.

- [Run Praise on a server](/server-setup)
- [Run Praise locally](/local-setup)
