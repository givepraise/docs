# Step 2 - Quantify

Quantification is the process of assigning a numerical score to each praise statement based on its perceived impact and value to the community.

### Why quantify?

Quantification transforms subjective peer feedback into objective metrics that can power community intelligence, reputation systems, and tokenized rewards.

### Who are the Quantifiers?

Quantifiers are trusted community members who independently review praise statements and score them on a predefined scale.

Quantifiers are randomly assigned praise items to avoid bias. Each praise is scored by multiple quantifiers and their ratings are averaged to determine a final score.

### Scoring Guidelines

Praise believes in a bottoms up approach to scoring. Quantifiers are encouraged to use their own judgment to assign scores based on the perceived impact of each praise. Over time, this will lead to a more accurate scoring system that reflects the values of the community. The goal is to create a system that is both objective and flexible. The scores should reflect the values of the community, rather than being imposed from the top down.

### Avoiding Manipulation

Several safeguards are in place to prevent score manipulation:

- Quantifiers work independently without knowing others' scores
- Random assignment makes collusion difficult
- Requiring multiple scores per praise mitigates personal bias

### Generating a Praise Score

Each Praise receives at least 3 independent scores which are averaged to generate a final score:

```
Praise: "@john for writing a great tutorial on setting up Praise"

Quantifier 1: 55
Quantifier 2: 60
Quantifier 3: 65

Final Score = (55 + 60 + 65) / 3 = 60
```

This objective scoring data powers many benefits of the Praise system down the line.
