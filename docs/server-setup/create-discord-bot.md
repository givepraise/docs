# Create the Praise Discord bot

## Step 1 â€“Â Enable Developer Mode

Discord Developer Mode needs to be enabled so that you can copy object IDs from discord's UI. You can toggle this setting in the `Advanced` section of your Discord User Settings.

- Under `Applications` click on `New Application` on the top right.

- Choose a suitable name for your application.

## Step 4 â€“ Add bot to application

- Open the `Bot` tab in the info page of the application you just created
- Create a bot using the `Add Bot` button.
- In the `Bot` tab, find the `Privileged Gateway Intents` section and enable `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT` and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`.

## Step 5 â€“ Reset and copy bot token

- Press the `Reset Token` button to reset and generate a bot token.
- Copy and note the generated bot token. This is the Praise ENV settings `Discord Token`.

:::warning

Do not share this token publicly and ensure that it isn't posted anywhere.

## Step 6 â€“ Note Discord Client ID

- Go to the `OAuth2` tab of your application.
- Copy and note `CLIENT ID`. This is the Praise ENV settings `Discord Client ID`.

## Step 7 â€“ Invite bot to Discord server

Invite the bot to your server using this link:

```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT ID>&permissions=274878023680&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

Replace `<CLIENT ID>` with the numeric CLIENT ID you just copied.

## Done ðŸŽ‰

If you have taken note of the `Discord Guild ID`, `Discord Token` and `Discord Client ID`, you have all the information you need to proceed with the configuration of Praise.
