# How to upgrade Praise

The process of upgrading Praise to a new version is usually very straightforward. Most of the time the process consists of running the bundled upgrade script.

## Step 1 – Use ssh to access server

```
ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

## Step 2 – Pull latest changes from the code repository

```
cd praise
git pull
```

## Step 3 – Run upgrade script

```
bash upgrade.sh
```

## 👍 That's it

Your praise system should be upgraded!
