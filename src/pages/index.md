Praise is a community intelligence system that promotes active participation and collaboration through peer recognition and rewards.

## How does it work?

```
/praise @vitalik.eth for "inventing Ethereum"
```

Community members interact with a Discord Praise bot to acknowledge each other's contributions. This bottom-up approach to value recognition keeps the community engaged and invested. Praise can recognize any contribution, big or small, and even those made outside of any platform. This improves cooperation and promotes a more positive and productive community.

## On what platforms is Praise available?

The praise bot currently is available for Discord. More platforms will be added in the future.
